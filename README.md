This is a python program called STAND OR SINK.

It was my final project for the Stanford Code in Place 2025 course. It therefore uses the graphics.py library from the course and may have a few functions that are different or not part of the standard tkinter python library. 

The objective of the program is create a simple educational geotechnical based program. It asks for user inputs while gently and sometimes humorously teaching users some basic concepts used in foundation design. And as you learn, you get to some graphics of your building.
